How about translating the license and the FAQ into other languages?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

   SIL certainly recognises the need for people who are not familiar with
   English to be able to understand the OFL and this FAQ better in their own
   language. Making the license very clear and readable is a key goal of the
   OFL.

   If you are an experienced translator, you are very welcome to help
   translating the OFL and its FAQ so that designers and users in your language
   community can understand the license better. But only the original English
   version of the license has legal value and has been approved by the
   community. Translations do not count as legal substitutes and should only
   serve as a way to explain the original license. SIL - as the author and
   steward of the license for the community at large - does not approve any
   translation of the OFL as legally valid because even small translations
   ambiguities could be abused and create problems.

   We give permission to publish unofficial translations into other languages
   provided that they comply with the following guidelines:

   - put the following disclaimer in both English and the target language
     stating clearly that the translation is unofficial:

      "This is an unofficial translation of the SIL Open Font License into
      $language. It was not published by SIL International, and does not legally
      state the distribution terms for fonts that use the OFL. A release under
      the OFL is only valid when using the original English text.

      However, we recognize that this unofficial translation will help users and
      designers not familiar with English to understand the SIL OFL better and
      make it easier to use and release font families under this collaborative
      font design model. We encourage designers who consider releasing their
      creation under the OFL to read the FAQ in their own language if it is
      available.

      Please go to http://scripts.sil.org/OFL for the official version of the
      license and the accompanying FAQ."

   - keep your unofficial translation current and update it at our request if
     needed, for example if there is any ambiguity which could lead to confusion.

   If you start such a unofficial translation effort of the OFL and its
   accompanying FAQ please let us know, thank you.

`The text of the current version of the OFL <http://scripts.sil.org/OFL_web>`_.
If anyone is interested in translation both the OFL and its FAQ
`please let me know <mailto:fontforge_devel@lists.sourceforge>`_ (via
mailing list) and I will provide Web space for both. I had intended to include
these translations in the font's 'name' table, but have been asked not to
because of the possible legal ramifications.

OFL version 1.1 has been released in February 2007 I have collected the
:doc:`following unofficial translations <OFL-Unofficial>`.
