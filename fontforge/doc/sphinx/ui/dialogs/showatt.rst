Show Advanced Typographic Features
==================================

This dialog shows the contents of some advanced typography tables (GDEF, GPOS
and GSUB for opentype fonts, kern, lcar, morx, opbd and prop for Apple fonts) as
far as fontforge understands them. The dialog is hierarchical with the typical
boxed +/- signs used for opening and closing sub-levels.

The GSUB and GPOS tables are organized as one might expect. Underneath each
table is a list of scripts, underneath each script is a list of languages,
underneath each language is a list of features, underneath each feature is a
list of glyphs, generally with some description of what happens (in the example
a right the 'frac' feature turns 1/4 into Â¼). Some features are a little more
complex (the 'kern' feature has a list of all glyphs that kern with the first
glyph under the first glyph).

The morx and kern tables are also broken up into scripts (Apple doesn't treat
scripts at all, but it makes the state machines smaller, so fontforge uses the
concept anyway), but languages are omitted (Apple tables will be based on data
for the default language).

Pressing the right mouse button will bring up a popup menu which will allow you
to save the contents of the dlg (as utf8 text).
