Help Menu
=========

.. _helpmenu.Help:

.. object:: Help

   Invokes a browser and brings up contextual help on fontforge web site.

   If you define the environment variable :envvar:`BROWSER` so
   that it contains the name of the browser you like then FontForge will use
   that, otherwise it will try to guess something appropriate by looking at your
   PATH. On CygWin systems browsers that work in the windows world (as opposed
   to the cygwin sub-system) must be specified by a full path spec.

   FontForge will search for help in either /usr/share/doc/fontforge/ or on
   http://fontforge.sf.net/.

   understand before working on fonts.

   the web page.
